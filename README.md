# Interview questions

Here you will find a list of questions
I usually take inspiration from when I'm
outta topics during an interview.

I think
the most important parts of the interview
are the conversation and the attitude that
the candidate shows in front of you (and your
other colleagues, if he does multiple
interviews) but at the same time I usually
find myself comfortable discussing things
like "what do you think of multithreading?",
as these type of questions open the doors
for a more broader and interesting discussion.

(a tiny bit of the process I use is described [here](http://odino.org/things-i-ask-during-interviews/)
, but I should definitely spend some more time
to describe the method)

Questions are divided into different categories,
so I usually pick 5/6 questions in total -- the
whole interview usually lasts up to 1 hour
as there is an introduction on the company,
the introduction of the candidate etc etc. As I
said, I should spend some more time describing the
whole process in a while.
